Abstract:  
The mineralogical and chemical characteristics of asteroid and meteorite samples provide us with the only direct information about the conditions required for the formation and evolution of the solar system. It is very important to understand the extent to which the weathering process in space affects the extraction of mineral and composition information from the spectra of small planets. Space weathering refers to the surface changes caused by the irradiation of cosmic and solar wind ions and the bombardment of interplanetary dust particles (micro meteorites) on atmospheric free celestial bodies in the solar system. Space weathering affects the spectral characteristics of silicate rich celestial bodies, resulting in an increase in the spectral slope and a decrease in albedo in the ultraviolet visible near infrared range. Over the past three decades, the impact of space weathering on the interpretation of asteroid spectral data and the correlation of asteroids and meteorites has been a controversial field. Lunar space weathering has been well understood, but it cannot be extended to ordinary asteroids. The two best studied asteroids (433 Eros and 243 Ida) show distinct characteristics of space weathering. It can be concluded that little is known about the diversity and mechanism of asteroid space weathering. In terms of analytical methods, such as spectral parameter analysis (for example, based on the analysis of the energy band center and the energy band area ratio), the impact of space weathering is very small. By selecting appropriate methods to analyze S-complex near Earth Asteroids, we can obtain the surface mineralogical characteristics of asteroids that are almost unaffected by space weathering, which makes it possible to further study the geological history of asteroid matrix and its relationship with meteorites. The research on the diversity of space weathering processes on the surface of asteroids should be a fruitful field in the future.
