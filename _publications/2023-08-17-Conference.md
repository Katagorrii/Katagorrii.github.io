Abstract:  
Jupiter-Trojan asteroids, as fossils of planet formation, orbiting the Sun in Jupiterâ€™s stable Lagrange points, provide a unique and critical insight into planetary origins, the sources of volatiles and organics on the terrestrial planets, and the evolution of the planetary system as a whole. Until now Jupiter-Trojan asteroids have only been observed through remote spectroscopic measurements using ground-based telescopes or space telescopes, and they still remain one of the most enigmatic groups of celestial bodies. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in understanding physical properties and spectral properties, and there has been a revolution in thinking about the origin and evolution of Trojans. In terms of surface composition, fine-grained silicates that appear to be similar to cometary silicates have gradually replaced water ice and organics as a significant part of Trojan asteroids surface compositions, and a color bimodality may indicate distinct compositional groups among the Trojans. Whereas Trojans had traditionally been thought to have formed near 5 AU, a new paradigm has developed in which the Trojans formed in the proto-Kuiper Belt, and they were scattered inward and captured in the Trojan swarms as a result of resonant interactions of the giant planets. There are significant differences between current physical properties of Trojans and those of Kuiper Belt objects. These differences may be indicative of surface modification due to the inward migration of objects that became the Trojans. The upcoming Lucy mission will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a close-up exploration of these enigmatic small celestial bodies, potentially yielding important evidence for unraveling the mysteries surrounding the origin and evolution of Jupiter-Trojan asteroids. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the observational history, physical and spectral properties, material composition, formation and evolution of Jupiter-Trojan asteroids, as well as an introduction to the goals and objectives of the Lucy mission. This study serves as a support for potential future deep space exploration missions which may have the capacity of exploring asteroids.
