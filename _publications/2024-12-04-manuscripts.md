Abstract：  
Potentially hazardous asteroids （PHAs） pose a significant threat to Earth，with the potential to cause biological extinction and even human destruction. To cope with the impact risk of potentially hazardous asteroids （PHAs） and create a defense plan，the mineral composition of PHAs was studied using Modified Gaussian Model （MGM），and the relationship between meteorite analogues was established. The model obtained the individual absorption characteristics of minerals by deconvolution of mixture spectra. Applying MGM to six PHAs，the results show that the six PHAs are S-type，Sq-type and Q-type， respectively. The minerals are mainly composed of olivine，low-calcium pyroxene，and high-calcium pyroxene. The forsterite index （Fo#） is 0.68-0.76，and the proportion of high-calcium pyroxene is 0.17-0.38. The meteorite analogues corresponding to asteroids Itokawa，Geographios，Apophis and Apollo are LL chondrites，and the meteorite analogues of asteroids Tomaiyowit and Touratis are similar to L chondrites.
